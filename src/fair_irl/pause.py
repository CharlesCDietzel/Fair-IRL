"""
Pausing and resuming the experiment script between trials.

`uv run fair-irl-pause` asks the running experiment (`uv run fair-irl`) to
pause. The experiment checks for the request each time it finishes a trial.
When it finds one, it writes a checkpoint and exits. `uv run fair-irl-resume`
(see `fair_irl.Fair_IRL_Biased_Demonstrations.resume_main`) then continues
from that checkpoint with the next trial.

Resuming gives exactly the results an uninterrupted run would have. The
experiment's only randomness that carries over from one trial to the next is
the global numpy and `random` generators (every other generator is seeded
afresh for each trial, from values that depend only on the config). So the
checkpoint holds those generators' states, along with everything else needed to
rebuild the run:

* the config file's contents and the `--set`/`--annotate` values, so that
  editing the config file while the experiment is paused changes nothing,
* the W&B session id, so that the resumed runs join the same session,
* which trial was the last to finish,
* the generators' states when that trial's experiment started, which its
  dataset is regenerated from,
* the generators' states when that trial finished,
* the run results collected so far for `--results-file`.

Everything lives in `STATE_DIR`:

* `running.json`: which process is running a pausable experiment.
* `pause_request.json`: a pending pause request, naming the process it is for.
* `checkpoint.json`: the paused experiment.

Only one experiment can be paused at a time. This module imports nothing heavy,
so `fair-irl-pause` starts instantly.
